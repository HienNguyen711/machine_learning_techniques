#### Production pipeline - Big data 
+ Cluster deployment framework : HDP, Cloudera , Amazon Elastic MapReduce,Microsoft Azure HDInsight

+ Data acquisition : 
    + Publish-subscribe frameworks, Source-sink frameworks, 
+ Datastorage 
    + HDFS, NoSQL 
+ Data pocessing & preparation 
    + Data cleansing: Involves everything from correcting errors, type matching, normalization of elements, and so on, on the raw data.
Data scraping and curating: Converting data elements and normalizing the data from one structure to another.
Data transformation: Many analytical algorithms need features that are aggregates built on raw or historical data. Transforming and computing those extra features are done in this step
